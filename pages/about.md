See [Meetup](/meetup/) page for more details about meetup.

Browse around this website, and expore the collection of incidents and [learn](/learn/) from literature 
on how and why software systems fail, and how we can build better systems

## Why Failure modes?

Running things in production is hard and running distributed systems in production is extra hard.

Failure Modes is an effort to curate resources and stories from the community,
to learn and get better at running large scale software in production.
