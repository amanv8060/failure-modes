## What?
Failure modes is curated list of resources around how modern and complex software systems fail.
We have resources centered around failures and failures modes in software systems

## Why?
Running things in production in hard, and running distributed systems in extra hard.

It's an effort to curate resources and stories from the community, to learn and get better at running software in production.

We wanted to share and learn from community, so we created this website to collect resources

## Contributing
