# About Failure Modes

## What?

Failure modes is community of software practitioners that likes share and discuss about the failure modes they have seen in real life.

We have ocessonal Meetups in Bangalore, India. Meetups are invite only and follow [Chatham House Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_House_Rule) to ensure an safe space to share failiures. See [Meetup](/meetup/) page for more details.

This website is a collection of literature on how and why software systems fail :boom:

## Why?

Running things in production is hard and running distributed systems in production is extra hard.

Failure Modes is an effort to curate resources and stories from the community,
to learn and get better at running large scale software in production.
