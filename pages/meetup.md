# Failure Modes Meetup

We have ocessonal Meetups in Bangalore, India. Meetups are invite only and follow [Chatham House Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_House_Rule) to ensure an safe space to share failiures.

Meetup is invite only, and mostly announced on my [twitter](https://twitter.com/electron0zero).

We meet whenever whenever I have time to manage the logistics of the meetup, and have venue that can host.
