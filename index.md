# Welcome to Failure Modes :wave:

## What :grey_question:
Failure Modes is a curated list of resources around how modern and complex software systems fail.
We have resources centered around failures and failures modes in software systems.

## Why :thinking:
Running things in production is hard and running distributed systems is harder.

It's an effort to curate resources and stories from the community, to learn and get better at running large scale software in production.

## Failure Modes: Meetup :busts_in_silhouette:
We also run a bi-monthly meetup in Bangalore where we gather, discuss and learn from our failures. Our first meetup is scheduled on **January 25th, 2020** at [Clarisights HQ, Bengaluru](https://goo.gl/maps/gRzvgVVhhjcgdFNC8) between 4-6pm.
