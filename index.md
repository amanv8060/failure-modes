# Welcome to Failure Modes

## What?
Failure modes is collection of how and why software systems fail :boom:

## Why?
Running things in production is hard and running distributed systems extra hard.

Failure Modes is an effort to curate resources and stories from the community,
to learn and get better at running large scale software in production.
