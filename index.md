# Welcome to Failure Modes

## What?
Failure modes is collection of literature on how and why software systems fail :boom:

## Why?
Running things in production is hard and running distributed systems extra hard.

Failure Modes is an effort to curate resources and stories from the community,
to learn and get better at running large scale software in production.

See announcement [blog post](https://blog.clarisights.com/failure-modes-meetup)

## Contributing
Observed an interesting failure mode in your day to day job, report by [creating an issue](https://github.com/electron0zero/failure-modes/issues/new) and tell us what happened? how it happened? and how you recovered from it.

Wrote a blogpost about a failure you saw in production? [open an issue](https://github.com/electron0zero/failure-modes/issues/new) with blogpost link and I will add it to the website.

Saw something intesting about failure modes on the internet? [open an issue](https://github.com/electron0zero/failure-modes/issues/new) and share the link.
It can be anything from incident postmortems, blog posts, projects, talks, tweets, research, etc.

Huge thanks to our [contributors](https://github.com/electron0zero/failure-modes/graphs/contributors) :bowing_man: :bowing_woman: :tada:
